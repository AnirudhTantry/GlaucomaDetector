# GlaucomaDetector
This is a project I made in my 5th semester of engineering. The basic premise is to use a Convolutional Neural Network to recongize glaucoma in fundus images.The dataset to achieve this was sourced from Kaggle.

Due to size limitations, I have uploaded earlier versions of dataset and final model on Google Drive with public access to anyone who has the links given below:
