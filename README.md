# GlaucomaDetector
This is a project I made in my 5th semester of engineering. The basic premise is to use a Convolutional Neural Network to recongize glaucoma in fundus images.The dataset to achieve this was sourced from Kaggle.

Due to size limitations, I have uploaded earlier versions of dataset and final model on Google Drive with public access to anyone who has the links given below:

1.Original Dataset- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s4UVhdbT2khzB3iPGRJmu-aPiXN-IkwM?usp=sharing \
2.VGG-16 Model File- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1msbyIIElmDcZdAkCsHl1zNSAgIG4aCza/view?usp=sharing \

All .py files in repository contains the code used to get a dataset satisfactory for the model to train and test on. The Jupyter Notebook contains code for building the neural network, training and testing on obtained dataset,final evaluation metrics and testing on image from another dataset not used in training of the model.
